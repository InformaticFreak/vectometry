## Coming soon in 2021.9

* Add a Plane object (means a layer) and a Line object (means a straight line)
* Add function to calculate the distance between two vectometry objects, except Vector objects
* Add function to calculate the intersection of two vectometry objects, except Vector objects
* The coordinates to which a vector points should be returned as a reference to the Point object
* [Send Feedback](https://forms.office.com/r/CbG2G1aCDf)

## 2021.8

* Version system changed
* Fixed return of round function for Vector object
* Added unit function to get the unit vector of a Vector object

## 0.0.7

* Fixed wrongly specified required Python version; generally Python 3 was specified, but it must be at least version 3.6
* Fixed integration of the long description into the pypi.org page
* Added initialization with only two coordinates for 2-dimensional vectors and points

## 0.0.5

* Writing a complete help and readme
* Fixed problem where cross product gives wrong results
* Rewrote some parts of the Vector/Point object and other functions
* Redefined meaning of two same vector objects
* Added support for built-in round function

## 0.0.4

* Added a point object and integrated it into the vector object
* Added mode for angle function; returns angle in degrees with `mode="deg"` (default) and in radians with `mode="rad"`

## 0.0.2

* Fixed some minor issues

## 0.0.1

* First version uploaded
